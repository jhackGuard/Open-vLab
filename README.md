# Open-vLab
This is a new kind of collaborative project about knowing, sharing, teaching, learning ...

I am creating a platform where we can collaborate and contribute knowledge, learn and teach, where you can create communities on specific topics and where you can replicate the web and create new nodes.

If you want to participate in the project, you can contribute through the code or through contact us through the web www.openvlab.org
